# House-Price-Prediction
The House Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Bengaluru House Prices dataset.
Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and removing outliers.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful variables like price per square foot.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented regression models to predict house prices.

Model Evaluation: Used metrics like RMSE, RÂ² Score to evaluate performance.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Jupyter Notebook
